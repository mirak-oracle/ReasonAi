### How It Works

ReasonAI works by listening to your spoken words and transcribing them into written text. This text can then be copied and pasted into search engines, documents, or any other application. Here’s a step-by-step example of how it works:

1. **Activate ReasonAI:** Press the "Start Listening" button on the interface.
2. **Speak to ReasonAI:** Begin speaking your query or conversation.
3. **Transcription:** ReasonAI transcribes your spoken words into written text.
4. **Copy and Use:** You can then copy the transcribed text and paste it into any application, such as a search engine or document editor.

### Example

Sam does not know how to type or search online but can speak. He activates ReasonAI and speaks into it, saying, "Find information about healthy recipes." ReasonAI transcribes his words into text, which Sam can then copy and paste into Google to find the information he needs. This simple process allows Sam to access information and perform tasks that would otherwise be challenging for him.
